# Multi-Label-Classifier
## What is This?
This is the code for  a multi label classifier I developed to add tags to reviews from reviews scraped from ratemyprofessor.

## How does it work
- It utilizes transfer learning and is built upon BERT, it adds data from the data scraped from ratmyprofessor reviews. It predicts the rating tags for each review scraped from ratemyprofessor
